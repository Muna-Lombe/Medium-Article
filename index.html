    <h2>Cats</h2>
    <p>
      Cats have excellent night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision. This is partly
      the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the
      eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light. Large pupils are an adaptation to dim light.

    <h2>Dogs</h2>
    <p>
    Dogs have four legs and make a "bark," "woof," or "arf" sound. Dogs often chase cats, and most dogs will fetcha ball or
    stick. Dogs can smell and hear better than humans, but cannot see well in color because they are color blind.
